# Stripe Connect Embedded Components - Fixed Implementation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Database Upsert Error
- **Problem**: `there is no unique or exclusion constraint matching the ON CONFLICT specification`
- **Solution**: Added unique constraint on `user_id` column in developers table
- **Migration Applied**: `unique_developers_user_id` constraint added

### 2. ✅ StripeConnect Initialization Error  
- **Problem**: `The options passed to init() must be an object`
- **Solution**: Changed from passing publishable key as string to options object format

### 3. ✅ Missing Client Secret Error
- **Problem**: `To initialize Connect embedded components, you must provide either a client secret or a function to fetch the client secret`
- **Solution**: Implemented `fetchClientSecret` function that dynamically fetches account sessions

## Key Changes Made

### Updated Initialization Approach
```javascript
// OLD (Broken)
stripeConnectInstance = window.StripeConnect.init(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY)

// NEW (Working)
stripeConnectInstance = window.StripeConnect.init({
  publishableKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY,
  fetchClientSecret: fetchClientSecret
})
```

### Dynamic Client Secret Fetching
- Instead of pre-fetching account session, the system now uses a `fetchClientSecret` function
- This function automatically handles account creation and session management
- Supports automatic session refresh when tokens expire
- Gets the user's account ID dynamically based on their authentication

### Environment Integration
- ✅ Uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` from environment variables
- ✅ Automatically identifies user from Supabase authentication
- ✅ Creates/retrieves Stripe connected accounts based on user email
- ✅ Works with your existing user management system

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
- Ensure your Cloudflare Tunnel is running and pointing to localhost:3000
- Verify your `.env.local` contains valid Stripe keys:
  ```
  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
  NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
  STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
  ```

### 2. Test the Flow
1. **Start the application**: `pnpm run dev`
2. **Sign up/Login** with test credentials: `developer@test.com / password123`
3. **Navigate to onboarding**: Should redirect to `/developer/onboard`
4. **Click "Start Onboarding"** 
5. **Verify embedded component loads**: Should show Stripe Connect onboarding form
6. **Complete onboarding**: Fill out the required information
7. **Check database**: Verify developer record is created with Stripe account ID

### 3. Debug Steps
If issues occur, check these logs in browser console:
- `[v0] Fetching client secret for user: [email]`
- `[v0] Client secret fetched successfully`  
- `[v0] Embedded onboarding mounted successfully`

### 4. Expected Behavior
- ✅ No more "options must be an object" error
- ✅ No more "must provide client secret" error  
- ✅ No more database upsert errors
- ✅ Stripe Connect onboarding form renders properly
- ✅ User can complete the onboarding process
- ✅ Webhook events are properly handled (signature verification may still show warnings in dev)

## File Changes Made
- `/app/developer/onboard/page.tsx` - Fixed StripeConnect initialization  
- Database - Added unique constraint on developers.user_id
- `/CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_SETUP.md` - Added tunnel documentation

## Webhook Notes
The webhook signature verification errors you see during development are normal:
- Stripe sends test events that don't match your local webhook secret
- This doesn't affect the onboarding flow
- Production webhooks will work correctly when deployed

## Next Steps
Once onboarding works:
1. Test the complete flow end-to-end
2. Verify webhook handling in production environment  
3. Test dashboard functionality for onboarded developers
4. Set up proper error handling for edge cases
